Q) I start my application and I don't see anything? It worked before!

A) If running a tutorial or demo:
      Did you start the application / emacs and slime in the directory of clog? 
      By default that is /common-lisp/clog?

      Or you can use (defparameter clog::*overide-static-root* #P"~/common-lisp/clog/static-files/")
      to overide the static path in (clog:initialize)

   If running your own app. Make sure the :static-file key is set correctly on (clog:initialize)
